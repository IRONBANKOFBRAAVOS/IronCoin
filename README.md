# IronCoin is the token of the Iron Bank of Braavos

History

The Iron Bank was founded long before the Doom of Valyria, when Braavos was still a "secret city", hidden from the Valyrian Freehold. It was formed by successful traders and craftsmen. Its name comes from the abandoned iron mine in which the bank's founders placed all their funds. The mine had a single entrance, which they sealed with heavy gates and iron bars and protected by guards hired jointly by all the members. The Iron Bank has moved to new, grander quarters since that day, but the mine is still employed as a depository, as well as being a historical site of the city.

What are we?

The Iron Bank is located in the Free City of Braavos. It is arguably the most powerful financial institution in the Known World, with clients across Essos and Westeros, including lord, government, and King.

What do we do? 

When in need of financing to purchase a new castle or afford a major war expense, The Iron Bank can provide the assistance you need to achieve your goals and find financial stability.The Iron Bank treats everyone equally. Whether you're a Prince or a peasant, the Iron Bank doesn't take debt lightly, and it doesn't forget.

Why are we so powerful?

Each of the Nine Free Cities has its own bank, for depositing and lending money. The largest bank by far is the Iron Bank of Braavos, which is as large and wealthy as the banks of all the other eight put together. When princes or kings default on their debts or are foolish enough not to honor their agreements with the Iron Bank, new princes and kings appear with the Iron Bank's support. These new princes and kings then honor the previous debt along with paying back the money the bank loaned them in claiming their new power, lest they suffer the same fate as their predecessors. "The Iron Bank will have its due" is a common saying among Braavosi.

What is the Ironcoin symbol ? 

The Titan of Braavos is a massive statue that guards the harbor entrance to Braavos, one of the Free Cities. It stands nearly 400 feet tall. As a major landmark, the Titan is often used as a symbol of the city itself. The image of the Titan appears on Braavosi coinage.
